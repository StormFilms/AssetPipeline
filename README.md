# AssetPipeline
A C# tool for handling an asset pipeline

# TODO
* Implement a plugin system that reads a C# file, compiles it at runtime and calls a main method. That way I can create asset pipelines using plain C# code, and have the program run different pipelines simply by providing a plugin name as an argument.
* Move the most handy utilities into a static library class.
